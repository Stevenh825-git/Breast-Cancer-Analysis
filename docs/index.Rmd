### Goal 


This analysis will investigate potential factors towards a patient's survival of breast cancer.

Such as: 

* Protein Evaluation Levels
* Type of Surgery
* Stage of Cancer
* Patient's Age

Understanding what may influence survival could help more people struggling with breast cancer. 

## Understanding the Data {.tabset}

Data was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kreeshrajani/breast-cancer-survival-dataset)

### Libraries

```{r libraries, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Loading libraries necessary for analysis 
library(tidyverse) 
library(janitor)
library(ggpubr) # Obtain function needed for Correlation Coefficient
```

### View the Data

* View the first few rows to see how the data was organized

```{r Open Data,message=FALSE}
cancer_data <- read_csv('Breast_Cancer_Data.csv')
```

```{r Data Peak, echo=FALSE}
knitr::kable((cancer_data[1:6,]), caption = "TABLE 1.1: Glimpse of the Data",digits = 2)

```


### Data's Structure 

* View the column names

```{r Structure, warning=FALSE}
colnames(cancer_data)
```


* There are *334* different patients with *13* columns of patient information

```{r Structure pt2, warning=FALSE}
glimpse(cancer_data)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE,results='hide'}
# Ensure data names contain valid characters
cancer_data <- clean_names(cancer_data)
```

## Comparing Data Statistics

The following tables highlight:

* The amount of patients  
* Average expression levels of Proteins 1 - 4  
* Percentage of Patients alive  
* Amount of patients whose survival status is unknown   
* Percentage highlighting the amount of cases of stages 1-3  

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
Overall_stats <- data.frame(count = length(cancer_data$age), 
                            protein1_mean = mean(cancer_data$protein1),
                            protein2_mean = mean(cancer_data$protein2),
                            protein3_mean = mean(cancer_data$protein3),
                            protein4_mean = mean(cancer_data$protein4),
                            survival_rate = paste0(round(length(which(cancer_data$patient_status == 'Alive')) / 
                                            length(cancer_data$patient_status)*100,2),"%"),
                            unknown_status = length(which(cancer_data$patient_status == "Unknown")),
                            stage1_percent  = paste0(round(length(which(cancer_data$tumour_stage == 'I'))
                                                    /length(cancer_data$tumour_stage)*100,0),"%"),
                            stage2_percent  = paste0(round(length(which(cancer_data$tumour_stage == 'II'))
                                                    / length(cancer_data$tumour_stage)*100,0),"%"),
                            stage3_percent  = paste0(round(length(which(cancer_data$tumour_stage == 'III'))
                                                    / length(cancer_data$tumour_stage)*100,0),"%"))
```


* The following table shows the statistics between **all 334 patients**:


```{r,echo=FALSE}

p  <- Overall_stats
colnames(p) = c("Patients", "Protein 1", "Protein 2", "Protein 3",
                "Protein 4", "Survival Rate", "Unknown", "Stage I",
                "Stage II", "Stage III")

knitr::kable(p, caption = "TABLE 2.1: Data Set Statistics",digits = 2)

```

```{r Yearly Stats, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
year_stats <- cancer_data %>% 
  group_by(surgery_year) %>% 
  summarize(Patients = n(), "Protein 1" = mean(protein1),  "Protein 2" = mean(protein2),
            "Protein 3" = mean(protein3),  "Protein 4" = mean(protein4),
            "Survival Rate" = paste0(round(length(which(patient_status == 'Alive')) / 
                                            length(patient_status)*100,2),"%"),
            "Unknown" = length(which(patient_status == "Unknown")),
            "Stage I"  = paste0(round(length(which(tumour_stage == 'I'))
                                                    / length(tumour_stage)*100,0),"%"),
            "Stage II"  = paste0(round(length(which(tumour_stage == 'II'))
                                                    / length(tumour_stage)*100,0),"%"),
            "Stage III"  = paste0(round(length(which(tumour_stage == 'III'))
                                                    / length(tumour_stage)*100,0),"%"))
```


* Splitting the data by the *year* a patient had their surgery:


```{r,echo=FALSE}

colnames(year_stats)[1] <- "Surgery Year"
knitr::kable((year_stats[,]), caption = "TABLE 2.2: Yearly Statistics",digits = 2)

```

Result:

* The survival rate is consistent throughout the data  
  * About 75%-77%  
* 2018-2019 had similar percentages across stages 1-3  
  * 2017’s difference possibly stems from smaller pool of patients
* The Patients whose status is unknown is spread unevenly   
  * Lack of information in data set   

Future analysis needed to grasp the difference between the Protein expression levels throughout the years.

## Comparing Protein Expression Levels {.tabset}

The following graphs' axis are the patient's **expression levels** for two different proteins 

* Expression Levels: State how proteins are *maintained* and *changed*  
* Goal: To identify if there is a relationship between 2 Proteins that can help identify a patient’s survival 



### Protein 1 vs 2{.tabset}

#### Chart
```{r Protein 1 vs 2 Chart, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```

* Protein 1 and Protein 2 have no significant positive correlation
  * R Value: **0.24**
    * The closer to 1 or -1 , the stronger the correlation
  * The p value indicates this is a significantly insignificant result
* Although there are no deceased patients when both the proteins are low, the lack of a significant correlation makes these findings unreliable.

```

### Conclusion

* The Protein Expression levels hold **no strong correlation** with each other
  * Cannot be used to predict a patient’s expression levels
  * **Unreliable** patterns such as:
    * No deceased patients when protein 1 and protein 2 are low
    * Could be sample bias
  * No discernible pattern with patient survival 


## Surgery Type{.tabset}

Next is an attempt to identify whether the **type** of surgery  patient their **survival** later in life 

  * Try to see if the cancer’s stage affects the results 


### Chart 

```{r Surgery Type Chart, echo=FALSE}
# Grouped  bar chart showing the patient status for each surgery type divided by cancer stage
ggplot(data = cancer_data, aes(x = tumour_stage))+
  geom_bar(aes(fill = patient_status),position = 'dodge') +

## {-}

**Stage 1:**

* *Lumpectomy* had the **most** patients alive and tied for the least deceased  
* *Modified Radical Mastectomy* most concerning when 5 alive and 2 deceased  
  * Seems unreliable

**Stage 2:**

* *Simple Mastectomy* had **38** alive patients, while having the *least deceased* (5)  
* *Modified Radical Mastectomy* had same amount of alive patients, but almost *twice* as many later deceased (9)  
* *Lumpectomy* had **least** patients alive (29), while having concerning amount of deaths (7)  
* Other types of surgeries are the most concerning with 17 patients dead and 39 alive

**Stage 3:**

* *Lumpectomy* remarkably had **no** deaths, with 8 alive  
* *Simple Mastectomy* is **unreliable** with 5 alive and 4 dead  
* *Modified Radical Mastectomy* has a good ratio for an advanced cancer stage  
  * 29  Alive, 9 deceased

**Conclusion**:

The type of surgery seems to correlate with the likelihood a patient will live years after surgery.

Some surgeries perform far better in different stages:

* **Lumpectomy** is the most reliable for stage 1, and great for stage 3  
* **Simple Mastectomy** has favorable results for stage 2  
* **Modified Radical Mastectomy** has consistent patterns for stage 2 & 3  

**Limitation**:

The data set doesn’t specify if the patient’s cause of death is related to the cancer **or** the result of something else.

* Further analysis is needed for clarification


## Cancer Stages Spread Across Ages{.tabset}


The goal is to identify how patient’s ages spread in the data set. 

* What ages have the most instances of cancer   
* How different stages of cancer is spread by age  
* Identify patterns between patients that are alive or deceased  


### Chart 

```{r Cancer Stage Age Chart, echo=FALSE}
cancer_data %>% 
  filter(patient_status != 'Unknown') %>%

    labs(title = "Age Range of Patients",
         subtitle = "Split By Tumor Stage",
         x = "Age",

    theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#FBD7CD'),
          legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#FBD7CD"),
          plot.caption.position = 'plot') +
    facet_wrap(~patient_status)
```


### Code

```

          plot.caption.position = 'plot') +
    facet_wrap(~patient_status)
```
## {-}

There is a notable bell curve in the data:  

* Most of the data is between ages 40-80 for both groups  

Patients that are **alive**:  

* Most cases between ages 40-80 see Stage 2 as the most common diagnosed   
  * Stage 1 and 3 are both prominent between 40-80 as well
* Cases rise as patients grow closer to 60, but decrease the older patients are

Patients that are **deceased**:

* Very rarely did a patient die from Stage 1, regardless of age. 
* Most cases of death were patients diagnosed with Stage 2 or 3
  * Stage 3 being prominent between late 40s and late 50s
* Rise in cases between late 40s and 70s, but a significant decrease afterwards. 


## Patient Survival By Surgery Year{.tabset}

Next, it is to investigate whether the year a patient had their surgery would affect their chances of a future.

### Chart

```{r Survival Year Heat Map, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
cancer_data %>% 
  group_by(surgery_year,patient_status) %>% 
  summarize(count = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping =aes(x = surgery_year, y = patient_status,fill = count)) +
    geom_tile(color = 'black', lwd = 1.5,) +
    geom_text(aes(label = count), color = 'black',size = 6) +
    coord_fixed() +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = 'OrRd',direction = +1) +
  labs(title = "Current Patient Survival Split By Year",
       y = "Patient Status",
       x = "Year of Surgery", 
       fill = "Number of Patients",
       caption = 'Some patients whereabouts are unknown') +
  theme(plot.background = element_rect(fill = '#FBD7CD'),
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = '#FBD7CD'),
        legend.background = element_rect(fill = "#FBD7CD"),
        plot.caption.position = 'plot')
```

Although 2018 seemed to perform the best, there are a few things to consider:

1. There are far more patients in the data set whose surgery took place in 2018
    * Table 2.2: 
      * **2017** : **61**	Patients  
      * **2018** : **152** Patients 
      * **2019** : **121** Patients 
2. The survival rate is almost the same, regardless of the amount of patients
    * Table 2.2: 
      * **2018** : **75.41%** 
      * **2018** : **77.63%** 
      * **2018** : **75.21%** 

It is unlikely the year a patient had their surgery would affect their chances of survival.

# Breast Cancer Dashboard

Summarizes key points discussed:

* Stages of cancer between ages  
* Scatter plots for protein expression levels
* Survival rate of different surgeries

Additionally, filters allow for a more in-depth look at the data

* Most filters are connected between all three charts
* Age Range applies to *Different Stages of Cancer Split By Age* & *Protein Expression Levels*       

Allows for user to specify:

* Age range
* Stage of Cancer
* Type of Breast Cancer
* Patient's Status (Alive, Dead, or Unknown)

The Histology filter helps further  identify any patterns among the different surgeries

### {.tabset}
#### **Stage 1**

* Lumpectomy had two patients deceased for Stage 1
  * Both are from an Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma
  * 3-0 for Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma & 2-0 Mucinous Carcinoma 
* Modified Radical Masectomy performance dependent on type of cancer:
  * Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma: 4-2
  * Mucinous Carcinoma : 1-0

#### **Stage 2**

* Previously stated *Simple Mastectomy* had **38** alive patients, while having the *least deceased* (5)
  * Filter showed it performs best against Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (21-4) but not as impressive against Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma
    * *Simple Mastectomy* : 7-1
    * *Modified Radical Mastectomy* : 13-1
    * *Lumpectomy* : 7-1
    
* *Lumpectomy* was shown to have the  **least** patients alive (29), while having concerning amount of deaths (7)  
  * Yet filters highlight its good performance against Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (21-4) & Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma (7-1)
  * Performed poorly against Mucinous Carcinoma (1-2)

#### **Stage 3**

* *Lumpectomy* had **no** deaths against Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma & Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma
  * No patients had Mucinous Carcinoma for Stage 3
* *Simple Mastectomy* is still **unreliable** against Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (4-4)
  * Although against Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma it had no deaths (1-0)
* *Modified Radical Mastectomy* is great against Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (23-4)
  * Conscerning against Infiltrating Lobular Carcinoma (6-5)

#### **Conclusion**

Utilizing filters allowed for a deeper analysis on the performances of different surgeries

  * Highlights which surgeries were better for which type of breast cancer

These factors seem to influence a patient's chances of survival post-surgery:

* Different stages of cancer
* The type of Breast Cancer 
* The type of Surgery



## Final Thoughts


* It is unlikely the year a patient had their surgery would affect their chances of survival.
  * The survival rate is consistent
    * About 75%-77%  

* The Protein Expression levels hold **no strong correlation** with each other
  * Cannot be used to predict a patient’s expression levels
  * No discernible pattern with patient survival 

* Those with cancer are likely to be between ages 40-80  
  * Stage 2 is the most common   
  * Cases rise as patients grow closer to 60, but decrease the older patients are
  * Very rarely did a patient die from Stage 1, regardless of age. 

* Factors seemingly influence a patient's chances of survival post-surgery:
  * Different stages of cancer
  * The type of Breast Cancer 
  * The type of Surgery


**Limitations**:

* Unspecific cause of death
* Lack of information on the "Unknown" Patients
* Possible sample bias in data set
* Unequal spread of type of cancer patients had 

Further analysis needed to ensure these limitations didn't impact the results.
